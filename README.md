# Gamified historical walks

## Outline
Gamify the visitation of historical places throught the city and use VR/AR to enrich the user's experience.

### Gamebook/story
It coulde guide you through the city - to visit a sequence of locations - to tell the (specific) story of an era (age), area or person.

### AR/VR 
Use VR/AR to present more information about a particular place/facility.
Use even more VR/AR content to demonstrate the environemnt of the age. Like, see a battle that took place on this location, or what the buildings looked like, or trade streets etc.

### Gamification
Achievements for visiting all of the historical places in one area or all of the places of one category in a given area, e.g. all monuments or all cathedrals, etc.

## Benefits
Gamifying the tourism could make (hook) people to walk around more (be more active) and at the same time - visit more of the local "attractions" (historical places). This would be beneficial for tourism as more people would like to visit more places.

## Children
 - Have an additional small animal figurine near the basic monument/location that woudl be fun for kids. It could be "checked in" in the application and marked as visited/seen by the kids - have them collect them all.

## Other
 - Could be used for educational purposes, e.g. have a class of students walk around and see all the churches (or monuments), important to a particular age. To be more than just a teacher who would walk with them and explain, there could be more rich content, e.g. AR/VR information or visualisations.
 - Rating for visitors, e.g. "4th level tourist"

## TODO/Problems
 - Find the locations of the monuments - data from the government?
  - No data can be found with a quick search in http://opendata.government.bg
 - If Google Maps' Places API is used - it's paid.
 
# Previous ideas
 - Google maps reviews of playgrounds - use gamification to motivate people to visit their local ones
  - Cons:
    - No improvements over Google Maps
  - Pros:
    - Added value / fun element (gamification) - does your neightborhood has better reviews?
